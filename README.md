# CODE2040
My name is Kymberlee Hill and I am currently a sophomore CS major at Howard University. Repository holds my answers to the Code2040 API Challenge. This challenge had various problems that were all completed using PYTHON.

Code2040 API Challenge
** Stage I: Reverse a string
Objecive : Given a string, reverse it.

** Stage II: Needle in a haystack
Objective : Given a dictionary with two values and keys. The first value, needle, is a string, the second value, haystack, is an array of strings. I was responsible for telling the API where the needle is in the array.

** Stage III: Prefix
Objective : API gave me another dictionary. The first value, prefix, is a string, the second value, an array of strings. My job was to return an array containing only the strings that do not start with that prefix.

** Stage IV: The dating game
Objective: API gives you a dictionary. The value for datestamp is a string, formatted as an ISO 8601 datestamp. The value for interval is a number of seconds. I was responsible for adding the interval to the date, then return the resulting date to the API.

My Feedback:
Overall, I believe that the hardest part about this assignment was being able to learn how to use JSON with python to be able to send and recieve data from the server. If you couldn't figure this part out, then you couldn't finish or even start on the assignment.

This assignment really taught me how to think outside the box because I self taught myself a lot of material in the last two days. I'd been exposed to using API's in my mobile application development class year yet everything really clicked and came together when I did this assignment. Taught me that I am capable of learning things on my own no matter how difficult they are. Overall, this was a great learning experience. I am glad I was able to finish the challenge!
